# tableCreator.ps1 (v2.02) - UPDATED 15.4.2025
### ðŸ’¡ A tool to capture the schema of existing Sentinel table, and create new table with same schema!
https://github.com/markolauren/sentinel/blob/main/tableCreator%20tool/tableCreator.ps1

_(Due to some issue with Azure CLI & Cloud Shell (az monitor log-analytics query command) script v2 stopped working, however new v2.01+ now uses API instead and works. Tracking the issue here: https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/31168)_

### What's new
ðŸ†• Support for choosing table plan/type: Analytics, Basic, Aux/Auxiliary <br/>
ðŸ†• Support for defining interactive retention (for Analytics tier) <br/>
ðŸ†• Support for defining total retention <br/>
ðŸ†• Improved error handling <br/>
ðŸ†• Command line & visual improvements <br/>

### Usage:

1) **Modify the script with your own Sentinel**

- $resourceId = "/subscriptions/YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/YOUR_WORKSPACE_NAME"<br/>
 (To obtain this information, open "Log Analytics workspaces" in Azure - choose your Workspace - choose Properties - Resource ID)<br/><br/>

2) **Run the tool IN AZURE CLOUD SHELL !!**

- **./tableCreator.ps1** - and you will be asked TableName which schema we want to use, and new TableName which will be created using the same schema, table type, retention and total retention.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR

- **Command line usage**:<br/>
.\tableCreator.ps1 **-tableName** tableName **-newTableName** newTableName **-type** <analytics|basic|aux|auxiliary> **-retention** retentionInDays **-totalRetention** TotalRetentionInDays<br/>

Example: .\tableCreator.ps1 -tableName MyTable -newTableName MyNewTable_CL -type analytics -retention 180 -totalRetention 365


#### NOTICE: 
This tool uses kql "getschema", and for some reason it reports all the columns with type "guid" as "string". <br/>
If the table you're creating a copy has guid type column(s) it causes a mismatch with column types when creating DCR. Workaround is to modify DCR with transformKql:<br/>
_"transformKql": "source | extend SomeGuid = tostring(SomeGuid), AnotherGuid = tostring(AnotherGuid)"_ <br/>
Another workaround is to debug the script and interpret those columns on the fly. This is already done for SecurityEvent table.
